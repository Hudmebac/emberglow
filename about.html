    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <div class="bio-container">
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Zac, an 8-year-old adventurer! I came up with the idea for Emberglow when I had to create a mythical creature for school. 
            My dad and I teamed up to bring this project to life using cool tools like Co-Pilot and other AI. Together, we made stories, songs, and lots of fun pictures and videos. 
            It's been an amazing journey, and I can't wait for you to explore it with us!
        </p>
        <p>
            I love exploring new worlds, whether it's in video games or through books. My favorite stories are filled with magic and adventure, and I often imagine myself as a hero in those tales. 
            When I'm not working on Emberglow, you can find me playing Minecraft, where I build incredible structures and go on epic quests with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy drawing and creating my own characters. I like to think about what their stories would be and how they would fit into the worlds I create. 
            My dream is to become a game designer one day, so I can make my own games and share my ideas with others. 
            I believe that creativity has no limits, and I want to inspire other kids to follow their dreams too!
        </p>
        <p>
            Guess what? I'm also thinking about creating a new character that will be the opposite of Emberglow, inspired by a "Kelpie." Keep an eye out for that, it's coming soon!
        </p>
        <p>Lots of love, Zac Heggie</p>
